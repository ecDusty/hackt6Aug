# zuyin-mobile-web-app
A single page, responsive application. Zuyin ('footprint' in mandarin) is an application that offers people an interactive map to find points of interest near by, like: events, tastings, animal spotting, and other interests. Giving people a chance to discover things to see and do. I lead the team of 4 that built this application,a proof of concept, was built during a 24 hour Paperclip x BitwiseHacks Hackathon, and won our team first place.


## Application
The **backend application** is stored within the `backend` folder. Within this folder you'll see the servers GET and POST API information.

The **Front end** application is stored within the `frontend` folder. Within this folder you'll find the appropriate read me to getting started with the app.
